NEW README
==========

Silver Rocket will eventually be a simple music player that does very little
beside play music. I used to use Vox version 0.26 beta. After getting a new
laptop with OSX Yosemite, it turned out old versions of Vox didn't work, and the
new ones were full of garbage I didn't want.

Silver Rocket will be tailored around my specific, and probably stupid, wishes
for a music player. Epecially its absense of features I don't ever want to manage
a local music library again. I don't want to see my music. If I want to listen
to something I'll specifically select it. I don't want to browse. No playlists.
No preferences. Don't even show me the player if it can be helped.
